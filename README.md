Set-Up Dev Enviroment

I have installed Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/), which comes with Jypiter Notebook ( which i find good for beginners as me  .-))

I used TensorFlow(TF) and Keras ( are 2 key dependencies to run the algo: TF and Keras are Libraries. 

NOTE : INSTALL FIRST TF and then in the Terminal via cmd install Keras, and any other Lib required. 
TF MUST BE AS BACKEND

I used the following tutorial for installation in a Ubuntu Machine, but i installed in my MAC, cmd are almost the same

NOTE: Be sure to create a Kernel where to run the algo. That kernel must be shown in your Jypiter notebook ( maybe for most of u guys out here is evident, me.. took me a couples of nights to get to that point :v)
